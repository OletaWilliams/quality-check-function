I was struggling so badly and really didn‚Äôt think I was going to make it through at times. While trying to get medical help, I found the free year of Balance offer somewhere and figured it couldn‚Äôt hurt to try at that point, though I‚Äôd never really been a big believer in meditation.\\n \\nI am so happy to admit how wrong I was- this app helped my emotional health so much before and after I got the additional help I needed.  The sleep modules in particular were so helpful- Ofosu‚Äôs voice alone is so calming and peaceful, and the meditations really help my mind stop wandering until it can relax and I can fall asleep. There are so many great non-sleep modules as well for different situations - it seems like there‚Äôs something there anytime I need it. Sometimes I go in knowing I will feel emotional, but sometimes it sneaks up on me in an unexpected and beautiful way too. I just purchased the lifetime plan- even though I don‚Äôt rely on this as a crutch like I used to, it has become something I want to do instead of something I have to do to get though the day.',\n",

I was already using another well-known app pretty regularly, but the set-up of this one is just perfect. You can choose to follow along with a plan or open the app up for a quick single meditation based on your specific need at the time. And the best part is, you can choose the duration of time that works specifically for you. Usually it‚Äôs 5 or 10 minutes but with some, they go down to 3 minutes or up to 15. I cannot say enough good things about this app. Thank you for being so kind and generous with your software during this wild time; it does not go unnoticed. I will happily sign up for the paid subscription to this beautiful app when the time comes. \\n‚ù§Ô∏èü§∏\\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è\\n\\nSome kind suggestions:\\nI would love to see more single meditations added on a regular basis, or different variations of the same ones. For instance, with the concentrate meditation, I was surprised that it didn‚Äôt include visualization. On that note, I would LOVE to see an entire guided plan for visualization practice/learning how to visualize. It would be cool if there was a log to see which meditations you did on which days. Also, different breathing techniques included in different meditations ‚Äî I adore the ‚Äòenergize‚Äô single. That‚Äôs all for now. Thank you again, you beautiful humans! xoxo',\n",

I have since recommended this app to all of my family and friends and they too are very impressed. With all the things we have going on day to day, we tend to forget to take care of ourselves and we don‚Äôt realize how important self are is. The Balance app does just that, it helps you balance and manage those day to day stresses and make life more manageable and enjoyable. There‚Äôs truth in the saying ‚Äúyou need to stop and smell the roses,‚Äù and this wellness app helps you do that! I love the fact that Balance makes a personalized program to suit each individual‚Äôs needs based on how you answer questions within the app. There are also ‚Äúsingles‚Äù you can do that are helpful if you‚Äôre feeling a certain way or having trouble sleeping or focusing etc‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not usually one to write a review on an application but I highly recommend this app to everyone!!

I now find myself wanting to do the longer sessions.  I love that this program builds on the success of each session and gives you multiple techniques for your meditation toolkit.  Initially, I was disappointed that each meditation didn‚Äôt have some soothing spa music.  Now I‚Äôve come to welcome the silence because I can really hear myself.  This is a fantastic app and I can‚Äôt wait to see where it goes from here.  Please know that I‚Äôve never written an app review in my life, so this is the highest compliment I can possibly give.

It‚Äôs obvious that this company actually has a true passion for helping people, judging by the work they‚Äôve put into it and their free one year subscription! Their methods are evidence-based, no frills, and straight to the point so you can focus on learning and progressing your meditation practice without the type of trendy mind-clutter you get from Calm. Of all the meditation apps I‚Äôve tried, Balance is the most user-friendly. It‚Äôs well-organized, tracks your progress across different skill sets, and although it‚Äôs evidence-based, it won‚Äôt overwhelm the lay person with scientific details. Though if you do prefer more scientific explanations, I would recommend pairing this app with FitMind. I find that they complement each other quite well. (FitMind also has accessible options for those who can‚Äôt afford their prices). \\n\\nRunning this type of business requires hard work, and providing one year of it for free is unheard of in this broken capitalist society.

I discovered Balance through Instagram. I‚Äôve always been reluctant of ‚Äúmeditation‚Äù but after my first session, I cried because almost everything I was suppressing was slowly revealed. Suddenly, I realized that there was now someone who was willing to listen, had the patience to wait until I was ready, help me through the chaos, and made me realize that my emotional needs are not being met by those closest to me. In the past seven years, I‚Äôve been taking on the problems of those who can‚Äôt seem to handle their own, and I have been neglecting myself in the worst way. Sometimes, I didn‚Äôt think I was going to make it. I underestimated the power of taking a few moments to myself to focus, re-center, to be selfish for 10 minutes or less, and to know that if I am not functioning properly, everything else goes by the wayside. What an incredible difference Balance has made in only two sessions! Honestly, I find myself looking forward to the next session because it‚Äôs a place that I find solitude. My mom always said, ‚ÄúA person who really loves you, will guard your solitude.‚Äù',\n",

The interface is clean and easy to navigate, not cluttered or confusing. It‚Äôs easy to find classes, and they offer choices in length for each meditation in case you have more or less time. I really recommend their Fundamentals courses; when I started using Balance I had tried to meditate but it was hard for me. The Fundamentals I class is amazing for beginners and those who are daunted by the prospect of sitting still or needing to quiet their mind. As someone with ADHD, I can attest that the practice of meditation I‚Äôve cultivated through Balance has been really helpful in my daily life. I really enjoy their single meditations on ADHD refocus, as well as their self-esteem, grief, and anxiety meditations, as well as all the options for music made to help one focus.

I use Leah‚Äôs voice (there‚Äôs a male and female voice so you can choose what one you want)  and anyway it works like a charm every night.

I haven‚Äôt tried every meditation but some let you answer a few quick questions before you start to make it even more personal, one example being the frustration meditation (I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called). One time I was absolutely LIVID because of someone, and the meditation really gave me some perspective and calmed me down in the heat of the moment.

It‚Äôs actually way more layered and complex than I had ever imagined. I was so wrong about all of it. The idea of meditating seemed counter intuitive through the lens of anxiety and adult ADHD, both of which have kept me in constant motion from task to task. So I figured meditating would just increase my anxiety and make me more restless so I made up facts about it to myself and never tried. The barrier to entry is always what makes trying new things hard but for mediation Balance was a seamless and relaxingly simple experience. I started out with only 3 mins a day and instantly felt my stress, anxiety, restlessness dissipate, while my focus and mood improve drastically. Honestly I used to think the only way to feel this kind of relaxation and lowered anxiety was from a few drinks‚Ä¶..it‚Äôs great to know there is a much better, healthier and sustainable option. 10/10 I would recommend Balance to everyone and I‚Äôve suggest it to everyone I care about.',\n",

Although I have been through some formal trading in a grip setting with a Counsler and even have a therapist this app is fantastic. It‚Äôs starts you off slow and had me actually pick up on some of the things I missed in my class. They start you off slow and ask you personal questions so that they may build the sessions around you on a personal level. I love that! It‚Äôs like a real one one and it keep me wanting more. I retired now at 55 with a full pension with Medical and now I watch a spend time with my grandchildren. But who would have ever thought the rest of my life sound peaches and cream. I suffer from anxiety and stress that I know I bring upon myself which gets me physically and emotionally sick! I can‚Äôt watch my grandchildren like that. I have to be wit a sound mind loving and caring and let go and let God. I love this app as it allows me to do just that!!! Please continue to grow and help others as this is a blessed app for all that need it!! Happy holidays to all and may you find your peace! ‚ù§Ô∏è',\n",

It was impossible to quiet my mind or keep myself from distraction, and I would end the sessions more frustrated than I started. From the first Balance mediation, I was hooked. What I needed was GUIDANCE‚Äî instruction, someone teaching me to mediation skills, not just mediations telling me to quiet my mind and me not knowing how to do that. I have mediated everyday since downloading this app, and each day I learn how to do it better and better, which makes me keep coming back. It‚Äôs the best app for meditation, hands down. The foundations classes are fantastic for this, but also the singles are great as well ‚Äî I use the wind down and sleep ones every night before bed, I‚Äôve used anxiety and SOS many times in acute emotional states.

Have used all the meditations in the app whether it be a plans, singles or the immersive (these are pretty interesting too). Short summary 1) Bit size meditation will help you form the habit of getting into meditation which is pretty cool. 2) Each plan will develop a specific mental skill and continue to strengthen your mental well-being 3) Skills it will help you develop : Focus, Communication, Breathing, Relaxation, Concentration, Positivity, Labeling (i might be missing few) 4) Labeling skills is so great which allows mediator to bring back their focus if you wondered during meditation. 5) I like both meditators but Ofosu is my personal favorite. Overall i have learned over the period of time from great people that keeping myself happy is my responsibility 100% and no one else‚Äôs.

So far with Balance, I have a 41 day streak completing four foundations plans!

When I‚Äôm sad, I‚Äôm sad for a long time. When I‚Äôm angry and frustrated, I can be angry and frustrated for the entire day. These guided meditation sessions have been able to help me let go of those emotions, not to push them down and to hide them, but to simply let go. It also helps me because I can get so caught up in my own thoughts that it becomes so tiresome being in my own mind. Meditation helps me shift my focus from those thoughts. I‚Äôve been trying to meditate at least once a day, and it‚Äôs a little difficult some days. But the days that I do take the time for myself to meditate, I feel lighter and happier and like I‚Äôm able to step out from under the dark cloud of frustration, stress, worries, fears, sadness, etc. I‚Äôve seen an improvement in myself over these past couple of months and if it‚Äôs something that you think would be helpful for you, I hope you can find solace through meditation.',\n",

I also know that I can do the singles, but I would like to continue on Foundations.

It‚Äôs hard to get 10 days in a row but 3 days is doable for first timers. Also 10,000 minutes is almost 3 years of meditating daily for 10 minutes and there‚Äôs nothing in between 10 days and 10,000 minutes. That‚Äôs a huge gap.

I‚Äôve meditated before but always found my mind wandering and didn‚Äôt realize until last night that it‚Äôs ok for your mind to wander. It‚Äôs quite normal. I was having bad anxiety and couldn‚Äôt fall asleep. I was wide awake at 2am. When I first opened the app it asked me if I was wanting to go to sleep. I said yes! It then asked me if I‚Äôd like to do a sleep meditation. I thought I won‚Äôt go to sleep but I‚Äôll check it out. I turned on the meditation, got comfortable in my bed and laid my cell next to me. I wasn‚Äôt 3/4 the way through it and I was sleeping. I can‚Äôt begin to tell you how wide awake I was with an anxiety attack. I woke up a few hours later with my cell still laying next to me. I‚Äôm going to be using this app every time I feel anxious or any other feeling that I don‚Äôt want to have. Thank you for the free year. I‚Äôm sure at such an affordable price I‚Äôll keep it after the year is up. Blessings \\U0001fa75',\n",

I found both overwhelming and the apps were bloated with features. I even had a subscription for free and never used it :/\\nBalance does such a great job at keeping things simple. You just open the app and can get right to a meditation. I love that there is no decision fatigue because it‚Äôs super curated. \\nLeah is the most amazing coach. Her voice is so soothing, but not robotic. She finds the balance between calm and not cheesy. \\nI have completed almost every plan in the app. I wish there were more. I think the app is moving more towards being a sleep support app. The new meditations are only the Individual ones. Those are fine, but I like the plans because they‚Äôre a curated set of meditations that compliment and grow from each other. You really feel like you‚Äôre accomplishing something with each meditation. \\nMy one recommendation to the app designer is to make the meditation intros optional. Please include a SKIP button. There are three or more questions you are required to answer before the meditation even begins and it‚Äôs super annoying. \\nAlso, there is a transition state after finishing the questions, which claims to be personalizing the meditation. But just close the app and it skips it! Best bug ever. Please keep this!\\nThank you for making such a wonderful app. Has absolutely been life changing.',\n",

You are also able to choose the length of meditation you wish to complete, so whether you‚Äôre overwhelmed by the idea of sitting still for 10 minutes or just ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have time‚Äù you can always fit it in. \\n‚Ä¢ Content: The techniques used in the program I am following feel far more effective in capturing my attention than other apps I‚Äôve tried.

I have always stayed away from meditation because I can never turn my brain off and I figured I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do it well, but this app has really changed that for me. Ofosu‚Äôs voice is so calming, he really helps me to focus on the meditation and I actually look forward to doing it everyday. And the sleep modules are amazing! I have sound machines that I stopped using because the sounds were not good quality, but the choices in this app are stellar. If I had one complaint it would be I wish there were a few more time options on the sleep modules. There‚Äôs nothing between 3 hours & 8 hours. 8 hours is a little too long, but I‚Äôd like to play it a little longer than 3 hours to see if I can extend my deep sleep (the deep sleep module is my absolute fav!). If you guys could make more time options available, this app would be 10 stars!',\n",

Balance has an option of male or female voice, and i prefer the generic ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù accent. The singles are great, but where I‚Äôve found real value is in the Plans. I‚Äôve moved thru beginner plans and foundations into intermediate and advanced meditation over the course of a year. I don‚Äôt do it every day, but that‚Äôs my goal. And now I‚Äôm learning how to do self-guided meditations. My goal is generally to clear my mind, reduce the noise in my head, create space for intuition.

These techniques are introduced to you sequentially and very gradually, so it really helps you to learn them.\\nThe personalization of the sessions is at another level. With the other apps they typically check with you how you‚Äôre feeling and keep track of this in some sort of journal, but Balance uses that information, plus additional more specific information related to how comfortable you‚Äôre feeling with the new techniques, your level for each skill, among others, to create truly personalized sessions. This really helps you to grow in the different meditation techniques. \\n\\nAnother difference between Balance and other meditation apps, is that Balance offers quality over quantity. The other apps have literally hundreds of sessions that may overwhelm you if you are a novice at meditation. With Balance, you have a good number of programs and individual sessions that are really good in terms of quality.\\n\\nThe last good thing about this app is the price.

I have a neurological disease that causes me to stop breathing, and I have been put in the ICU for it... that statement being repeated over and over, was awful!!!

No other meditation app has that. Second, the app has all sorts of categories for what you are trying to target. For beginners they have a foundations plan that teaches you how meditation works. After every meditation they have you rate it and then the app tailors it based on your needs. For example, if you like more or less talking in in the sessions? body scan or breath focus? Before every meditation they give you useful information regarding how it is beneficial. It also gives you  a simple 3 question quiz to see if you retained the information they teach you. This has improved my life and when the trail ends, I am definitely starting my subscription. For those of you reading it is definitely worth a try.',\n",

This had never happened before but it didn‚Äôt think anything of it. However the percentage stayed at 0 and eventually a pop up appeared telling me that it didn‚Äôt work and asking whether I wanted to try again or stop trying. No matter what I pressed it did not work. This happened very time I tried to do a mediation and has been going in for about 3 days. Tonight I decided to log out and log back in, but then it told me it wouldn‚Äôt work because of an SSL error. I was really enjoying the app but I want to be able to actually use it instead of just letting my free year run out without me getting to actually use the meditations in this app. Please fix this.',\n",

Balance is different then most and is wonderful to use. You can customize the times and voices, it adjusts meditations  based on your needs and progress, and it is very patient and understanding that mindfulness is often a struggle for many. Also, the singles like Relax, Focus, etc. are very useful. One of the best parts of the app are the sleep and nap portions! When I can‚Äôt sleep this app is actually the only thing that I have found that can lull me into a slumber. And the nap portion is incredible - it gently guides you into dozing off and then plays the most wonderful, peaceful sound when it‚Äôs time to wake up.

I was never able to do pomodoro before, but with the choice of background sounds and the option for a meditation during the breaks, it‚Äôs been amazing. Today, I was so happy that I was able to focus that I actually giggled with joy. \\nSo I just wanted to say thank you, Balance. \\nAlso, looks like you‚Äôre working on improving your accessibility, Balance.

Balance is not only a beautifully designed application with a intuitive and compelling user experience, it‚Äôs also a powerful tool for progress and habit building.

Many adults nowadays are depressed and tired, but they don‚Äôt know how to speak english. For example, I wanted to tell someone about this app because I am sure it is going to help him, but he doesn‚Äôt understand English. In my opinion, translating the app to Arabic, Spanish, and Chinese, will cover 80% of the speakers in the world. This will be a huge step forward for the app. Please consider this update, many people need it.\\nThank you.',\n",

It feels more like a bunch of dumbed down lectures about meditation basics than actual meditations, and far from enhancing my practice, it has just been a daily source of frustration. I have to use my existing meditation skills to deal with the frustration of trying to meditate with this app lol.\\n\\nThe worst part is that even some of the basics they took the time to explain were explained poorly, so it wastes time for experienced users but I\\'m not sure how you would understand if you were inexperienced. I\\'ve been meditating for several years and this app spent several minutes talking about how my mind was like an empty garden when I first started using it, and how setting intentions is like planting seeds?? This feels like a metaphor you might use for teaching children.\\n\\nApps like Simple Habit, Buddhify, and Headspace are so much better than this, both at guiding you thru the basics and at helping you learn more advanced techniques.',\n",

My only concern which has nothing to do with the operational side is the cost. Surely for $359 even if it is discounted to $99 still feels quite a bit on the higher end. And so would be loyal customers like myself could get turned off by these really steep paywalls‚Ä¶so perhaps stagger the levels so that entry level which is perhaps half the cost helps those that want to first feel things out before entering the premium.

It‚Äôs incredibly simple and straightforward. The plans give you a recommended practice for your day but if you want to do a single it lets you pick by subject. This is great because I often jump to the app for a specific subject to meditate on. \\n\\n2. Aside from choosing from 2 voices, it allows you to change the length of the practice. This varies from 3 mins to sometimes 30. The one drawback I would say is there is not a long form (1 hour or more) practice. This isn‚Äôt a huge drawback because it‚Äôs so rare to do that but it would be so great when the moment strikes to go for something longer. \\n\\n3. THE SLEEP PROGRAMS.
